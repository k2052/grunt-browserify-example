# What is this?

A simple example of a [grunt-browserify](https://github.com/jmreidy/grunt-browserify) workflow. 
Compiles coffescript to js and then bundles it with some dependencies, in this case, [space-pen](https://github.com/atom/space-pen) and jQuery.

## Usage

Run:

    $ sudo npm install .
    $ grunt

Then:

    $ xdg-open test.html
